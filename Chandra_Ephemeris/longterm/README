1. dephem.pl is automatically run by cron to maintain 
the longterm ephemeris file: dephem.dat

2. manually run cocochan_de to convert dephem.dat to 
dephem.gsme and dephem.gsme_in_Re (takes a few minutes to run)

3. manually run dephem_quality_check.pl occasionally
to verify the continuity of the timestamps in dephem.dat
