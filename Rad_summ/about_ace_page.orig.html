About ACE Monitoring 
</h2>
</center>
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Science Operations Team has two proton monitoring systems.</h3>
<ol>
<li> Orbit Monitor:<br>
  

The fluence of ACE protons in the 130-214 keV energy range is
integrated over each Chandra orbit, while Chandra is above 70,000 km 
geocentric distance. The fluence measurement is reset to 0 while
Chandra is below 70,000 km.
<p>
If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
fluence and the integrated time.
<p>
The latest ACE proton flux, and the integrated fluence, are on the
top line of the  <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/mta/alerts/chandra.snapshot">
 Chandra snapshot </a>display (f_ACE and F_ACE respectively),
and on the SOT's  <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/mta/ace.html">
ACE page</a>.
<p>
	
<!---  Regarding EPHIN data,  our  P4GM channel  threshold in these OBC units is 118.08 cts/sample.
The E1300 threshold is 1318.56 cts/sample and the P41GM trigger is 100
cts/sample FYI. --> 

<p>
ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
<p>
An open-ended series of thresholds,
at 1E9, 3E9, 9E9, 27E9, 81E9, 243E9 etc.
For each threshold, issue 3 alerts at 30 minute intervals,
then increase threshold to next level.
Reset orbit fluence to zero, and reset threshold to 1E9 
at the end of each orbit.

<HR>
<li> Two Hour Monitor:
<h4><font color=FF0000> A violation of this limit is more serious than the orbital limit
since it implies a similar flux in a shorter time scale.</h4> </font>
<p>

The fluence of ACE protons in the 130-214 keV energy range is
integrated as a runing average over each 2 hour period.
This is 24 measurments during each period.  Bad measurments are
dropped and the average Flux particles/cm2-s-ster-MeV is calculated.
<p>
If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
fluence and the integrated time.
<p>
ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
<p>
Fluence threshold = 50,000 protons/cm2-s-ster-MeV average over a 2
hour window.

<ul>
<li>Alert list:  same as above


</ul> 
Alert scheme: 3 alerts, at 25-minute intervals. Once this alert
triggers it is disabled until manually rearmed by the MTA scientist.<br>




<hr>
<li> Kp Monitor:
<h4><font color=FF0000> A violation of this limit indicate the general
radiation state near the Earth is high.</h4> </font>
<p>

If the  value of Kp (projected) exceeds 5.5 a
yellow alert is gerated, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via email. The alert message provides the measured
Kp and the lead time.  If the observed Kp exceeds 6.0 or the projected
exceeds 6.5, alerts are also sent by page.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Alert list:  same as above
</ul> 

Alert scheme: 1 alerts,  Once this alert
triggers it is disabled for 6 hours.<br>

<p>
The latest ACE proton flux, the integrated fluence, and Kp are on the
top line of the  <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/mta/alerts/chandra.snapshot">
 Chandra snapshot </a> display (f_ACE, F_ACE and Kp respectively),
and on the SOT's  <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/mta/ace.html">

<li><a name="RADMON"> Chandra RADMON trigger levels</a>
<p>

RADMON will trigger SCS 107 (SI safing) if ANY of the following three 
EPHIN channels exceeds the on-board threshold for 3 consecutive samples.
EPHIN samples are sent to the OBC each 65.6 seconds.

SSD-opening. Once that is done, this file will provide us with the
